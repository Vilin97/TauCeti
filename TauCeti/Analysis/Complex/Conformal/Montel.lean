# Montel's selection theorem

A locally bounded family of holomorphic functions on an open set `Ω ⊆ ℂ` is a normal family: every
sequence drawn from it has a subsequence converging locally uniformly on `Ω`, and the limit is
again holomorphic. This is the **Montel selection** component of layer **L1 (normal families /
Montel)** of the conformal-mapping roadmap, and the compactness engine the Riemann mapping theorem
runs on. The other component L1 lists, Vitali's theorem, is proved in `Conformal/Vitali.lean`,
which applies the selection theorem below.

The equicontinuity half is already available in `Conformal/NormalFamilies.lean`
(`TauCeti.IsLocallyBoundedOn.equicontinuousOn`, from Cauchy's estimate); what is added here is the
selection argument that turns it into a convergent subsequence.

The proof is Mathlib's compact-open Arzelà–Ascoli framework, applied in `C(Ω, ℂ)`. The family
restricts to a set of continuous maps there;
`ContinuousMap.isUniformEmbedding_toUniformOnFunIsCompact` together with
`UniformOnFun.isClosed_setOfPred_continuous` exhibits `C(Ω, ℂ)` as a closed subspace of the
uniform-on-compacts function space, so
`ArzelaAscoli.isCompact_closure_of_isClosedEmbedding` applies: equicontinuity on each compact comes
from `IsLocallyBoundedOn.equicontinuousOn`, and pointwise relative compactness from local
boundedness. The closure of the family is then compact. An open subset of `ℂ` is locally compact
and second countable, hence σ-compact and so hemicompact — a countable cofinal family of compacts —
which is what makes the compact-open topology on `C(Ω, ℂ)` first countable (local compactness alone
would not suffice), and `IsCompact.tendsto_subseq` extracts a convergent subsequence. Finally
`ContinuousMap.tendsto_iff_tendstoLocallyUniformly` turns compact-open convergence into locally
uniform convergence, and `TendstoLocallyUniformlyOn.differentiableOn` gives holomorphy of the limit.

No compact exhaustion or diagonal argument is needed: Mathlib's framework subsumes both.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.montel` — a locally bounded family of holomorphic functions on an open set has a
  locally uniformly convergent subsequence, with holomorphic limit.

## Coordination with upstream Mathlib

Per the *Coordination with upstream Mathlib* section of `ConformalMapping/README.md`, L0–L3
material overlaps [mathlib4#33505](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/33505),
which proves a Montel equicontinuity statement internally as a private lemma. **This file is
therefore a temporary shim**: once the corresponding Mathlib results land, this statement should be
backed by them — or deleted and its consumers refactored — rather than maintained as an independent
re-proof. What Tau Ceti adds at L1 is named, discoverable API, not first proof.

Note this is the **analytic** normal-families theorem; it is deliberately not routed through
Mathlib's `Analysis/LocallyConvex/Montel.lean` (`MontelSpace`), which is an unrelated notion.

/-- **Montel's selection theorem.** A locally bounded family of holomorphic functions on an open
set `Ω ⊆ ℂ` is normal: every sequence from it has a subsequence converging locally uniformly on
`Ω`, and the limit is holomorphic.

The local boundedness hypothesis cannot be dropped: on any *nonempty* open `Ω`, the holomorphic
family `F n z = n` has no locally uniformly convergent subsequence. (On `Ω = ∅` the conclusion is
vacuous, so nonemptiness is needed for the counterexample.) -/
